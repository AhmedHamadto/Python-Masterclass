    "# 13. Exercises\n",
    "\n",
    "\"\"\"\n",
    "1. **Custom Exception Handling**:\n",
    "   - Create a custom exception called `InvalidInputError`.\n",
    "   - Write a function that raises this exception when input doesn't meet certain criteria.\n",
    "   - Handle the exception gracefully.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Context Manager**:\n",
    "   - Implement a context manager that times the execution of a code block.\n",
    "   - Use it to measure the time taken by a sample function.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Exception Chaining Practice**:\n",
    "   - Write a function that reads data from a file and parses it.\n",
    "   - Chain exceptions to provide context if file reading or parsing fails.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Asynchronous Error Handling**:\n",
    "   - Create an asynchronous function that may raise an exception.\n",
    "   - Handle the exception in an async context.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Logging Enhancement**:\n",
    "   - Configure the logging module to output logs to both console and a file.\n",
    "   - Log exceptions with different severity levels (INFO, WARNING, ERROR).\n",

    "# Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "\"\"\"\n",
