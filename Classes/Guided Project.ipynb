    "Sure, here's a comprehensive guided project that covers the concepts of classes, inheritance, encapsulation, method overriding, and polymorphism. This project involves creating a simple online shopping system:\n",

    "**Guided Project: Online Shopping System**\n",
    "\n",
    "In this guided project, you'll create a basic online shopping system with different types of products and a shopping cart.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Step 1: Create the Product Class**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Create a class called `Product` with attributes: `name`, `price`, and `quantity`.\n",
    "2. Implement a method to calculate the total price of a product based on its price and quantity.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Step 2: Create Product Categories**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Derive classes `Electronics`, `Clothing`, and `Food` from the `Product` class.\n",
    "2. Add additional attributes to each category, such as `brand` for electronics, `size` for clothing, and `expiry_date` for food.\n",
    "3. Implement methods to display information about the products in each category.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Step 3: Create the Shopping Cart Class**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Create a class called `ShoppingCart` with attributes: `items` (a list to store products) and `total` (to keep track of the total cost).\n",
    "2. Implement methods to add items to the cart and calculate the total cost.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Step 4: Implement Polymorphism**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Create instances of different product categories and add them to the shopping cart.\n",
    "2. Use polymorphism to calculate the total cost of the shopping cart, even when it contains products from different categories.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Step 5: Encapsulation and Method Overriding**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Use encapsulation to ensure that product attributes are set and accessed appropriately.\n",
    "2. Implement method overriding in the derived classes to display category-specific information about products.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Step 6: Interaction**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Create instances of products and add them to the shopping cart.\n",
    "2. Display the content of the shopping cart along with the total cost.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Step 7: Bonus**\n",
    "\n",
    "If you're up for a challenge, consider adding additional features like discounts, handling out-of-stock items, or implementing a checkout process.\n",
    "\n",
    "Remember, the goal of this project is to practice the concepts you've learned, so feel free to customize it and get creative!\n",
    "\n",
    "**Final Thoughts:**\n",
    "\n",
    "Completing this guided project will provide you with hands-on experience in creating a more complex application using the concepts of classes, inheritance, encapsulation, method overriding, and polymorphism. This will help cement your understanding and give you a practical sense of how these concepts are applied in real-world programming scenarios. Happy coding!"
