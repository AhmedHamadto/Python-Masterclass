    "Guided Project: Introduction to Python Functions and Lists\n",
    "\n",
    "In this guided project, you will learn how to use Python functions and lists, including list comprehension. The project will cover the basics of functions, creating and using lists, and various list manipulation techniques. By the end of the project, you will be able to write your own functions, work with lists, and use list comprehensions to make your code more efficient.\n",
    "\n",
    "Project Overview:\n",
    "The project will involve creating a simple program that performs various operations on a list of numbers. The program will prompt the user to enter a list of numbers, and then it will demonstrate different functionalities using functions and list comprehensions.\n",
    "\n",
    "Steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "Step 1: Getting User Input (20 minutes)\n",
    "- Ask the user to enter a list of numbers separated by commas.\n",
    "- Convert the input string into a list of numbers.\n",
    "\n",
    "Step 2: Basic List Operations (30 minutes)\n",
    "- Create a function to find the sum of the numbers in the list.\n",
    "- Create a function to find the maximum and minimum numbers in the list.\n",
    "- Create a function to find the average of the numbers in the list.\n",
    "- Display the results of these operations to the user.\n",
    "\n",
    "Step 3: List Manipulation (30 minutes)\n",
    "- Create a function to remove duplicates from the list.\n",
    "- Create a function to reverse the list.\n",
    "- Create a function to sort the list in ascending order.\n",
    "- Display the modified list to the user after each operation.\n",
    "\n",
    "Step 4: List Comprehensions (30 minutes)\n",
    "- Demonstrate how to use list comprehensions to generate a new list from the input list.\n",
    "- Use list comprehensions to create a list of squares of the numbers in the input list.\n",
    "- Use list comprehensions to filter out even numbers from the input list.\n",
    "- Explain the benefits of using list comprehensions over traditional loops.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Conclusion:\n",
    "This guided project will provide you with a solid foundation in using Python functions and lists. Where you will gain hands-on experience in creating functions, manipulating lists, and using list comprehensions for more concise and efficient code. They will be equipped with essential skills that can be applied to various real-world programming tasks."
